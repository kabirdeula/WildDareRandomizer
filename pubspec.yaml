# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/rules.json
    - assets/icon/
    - assets/fonts/poppins/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Thin.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
